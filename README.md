This project was part of The Odin Project‚Äôs React curriculum.

## üí° Learnings
- **Component structure:** splitting the app into smaller parts (GeneralInformation, Education, Work, and CvVision).
- **State management:** lifting state up to `App.jsx` so the CV preview updates instantly when typing in the forms.
- **Props:** passing data and handler functions between parent and child components.
- **Controlled inputs:** making form fields controlled by React state.
- **Dynamic lists:** adding and removing multiple education and work entries.
- **Conditional rendering:** toggling between collapsed ‚Äúcards‚Äù and expanded forms.
- **Exporting content:** generating a PDF with `html2pdf.js`.
